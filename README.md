# IR_analyser

## Project Function
> Using Python, the aim is to allow for quicker analysis of standard, chemical Infrared (IR) Spectra. 

### Current Status
> The program currently works as described below:
>>* Using a simple entry system, the user specifies the wavenumber of the peaks observed in the spectra until told to 'run'
>>* The script then takes the usre input (stored as a list) and then loops through the database file*
>>* If the user input matches a value in the range of the peaks, then that user input and peak information is written to new list
>>* Once the wavenumbers have been passed through the database, the loop stops
>>* The user is then prompted to enter a filename for the sorted peaks to be written to and saved 

### Future works
> While this project currently functions at a basic level the below updates are required or would like to be incorporated:
>>* To be able to take an image of an IR spectra as input rather than user inputting the numbers
